<!-- About the Project -->

## About the Project

`Hue-Sync` is a library that was created from the ground up to provide a simple and easy way to interact with the Connected Lighting Interface Protocol better known as [Philips Hue API V2](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api-v2/). There's a few reasons you should consider `Hue-Sync` over other alternatives:

- it uses HTTPS
- it's written in Typescript
- it supports Gradient Lightstrip Zones
- it uses mDNS discovery with remote API fallback

We aim to support as many features on the [official REST API Documentation](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api-v2/api-reference/) as possible.

<!-- Installation -->

## Installation

use your favourite package manager to install `Hue-Sync`:

> Node 18 or later can save on optional dependencies with `--no-optional`
> or `--ignore-optional` for Yarn

```bash
  npm install hue-sync
```

<!-- Usage -->

## Usage

To get started you will want to find your bridge in the local network, `Hue-Sync` uses mDNS as a primary means of discovery with a fallback to Phillip's Hue discovery API online

```typescript
import HueSync from "hue-sync";

const [myBridge] = await HueSync.discover();

mybridge.internalipaddress;
// "192.168.0.15"
```

once you have found your bridge you need to register your app in order to get credentials

```typescript
const appName = "my-rgb-app";
const credentials = await HueSync.register(myBridge.internalipaddress, appName);

credentials.username;
// KyBPfHmVUGSJNBr0Je5GwJzeRc6PXpsYfZki1IRl
credentials.clientkey;
// 936C90F4AD975945038B6C83B5A8101A9C38EA7C
```

with the credentials and bridge details you can now create a new `HueSync` instance and interact with the Hue Bridge directly.
 

```typescript
const hueBridge = new HueSync({
  credentials,
  id: myBridge.id,
  url: myBridge.internalipaddress,
});

const [myFavoriteLight] = await hueBridge.getLights();

await hueBridge.updateLight(myFavoriteLight.id, {
  on: { on: true },
});

await hueBridge.updateLight(myFavoriteLight.id, {
  dimming: { brightness: 75 },
});

await hueBridge.updateLight(myFavoriteLight.id, {
  color_temperature: { mirek: 300 },
});

// if the light bulb supports color mode
await hueBridge.updateLight(myFavoriteLight.id, {
  color: { xy: { x: 0, y: 1 } },
});
```
> Endpoints are capped by Phillips for performance reasons, if you need to send a continous stream of fast light updates please checkout the next section
### Entertainment API

Once you have created a `Hue-Sync` instance, you need to retrieve your desired entertainment area or default to the first one in order to activate streaming mode.

```typescript
const [selectedArea] = await hueBridge.getEntertainmentAreas();

await hueBridge.start(selectedArea);
```

this will initiate the dtls handshake and establish the Zigbee connetion with the bridge. Assuming you're using a lightstrip you should be able to assign a different color to each zone by passing an array of `[R,G,B]` values where each value is mapped to each zone. Once the program needs to close the dtls connection the user just needs to call `.stop()` and this will close connections and turn streaming mode off on the active entertainment area.

```typescript
// gradient lightstrips have 7 zones
const nextColors = [
  [217, 237, 146],
  [181, 228, 140],
  [153, 217, 140],
  [118, 200, 147],
  [82, 182, 154],
  [52, 160, 164],
  [22, 138, 173],
];

await hueBridge.transition(nextColors);

// ...

hueBridge.stop();
```

### Usage with HTTPS

To use HTTPS properly, the client has to validate the Hue Bridge certificate against the Signify private CA Certificate for Hue Bridges. This is typically done by adding the CA cert into the key store trusted by the HTTP client.

> please check out the [official docs on HTTPS](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/application-design-guidance/using-https/) for more information

The Hue Bridge certificate uses the bridge ID as the Common Name so requests must resolve the bridge ID to the local IP address, `Hue-Sync` achieves this internally by patching Node's DNS lookup. The CA certificate can be found at the root of the project as `signify.pem`, you must include this certificate using environment variable `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Alternatively, you can disable TLS verification through `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` however this is not recommended outside of the development environment.
